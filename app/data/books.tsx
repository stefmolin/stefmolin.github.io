          Data analysis has become an essential skill in a variety of domains where knowing how to
          work with data and extract insights can generate significant value.{' '}
          <em>Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas</em> will show you how to analyze your data, get
          started with machine learning, and work effectively with the Python libraries often used
          for data science, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
        </p>,
        <p key={2}>
          Using real-world datasets, you will learn how to use the pandas library to perform data
          wrangling to reshape, clean, and aggregate your data. Then, you will learn how to conduct
          exploratory data analysis by calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data to
          find patterns. In the concluding chapters, you will explore some applications of anomaly
          detection, regression, clustering, and classification using scikit-learn to make
          predictions based on past data.
        </p>,
        <p key={3}>
          This updated edition will equip you with the skills you need to use pandas 1.x to
          efficiently perform various data manipulation tasks, reliably reproduce analyses, and
          visualize your data for effective decision makingâ€”valuable knowledge that can be applied
          across multiple domains.
