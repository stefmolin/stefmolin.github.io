      description: dedent`Data analysis has become an essential skill in a variety of domains where knowing how to
      work with data and extract insights can generate significant value. *Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas*
      will show you how to analyze your data, get started with machine learning, and work effectively
      with the Python libraries often used for data science, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn,
      and scikit-learn.

      Using real-world datasets, you will learn how to use the pandas library to perform data
      wrangling to reshape, clean, and aggregate your data. Then, you will learn how to conduct
      exploratory data analysis by calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data to
      find patterns. In the concluding chapters, you will explore some applications of anomaly
      detection, regression, clustering, and classification using scikit-learn to make
      predictions based on past data.

      This updated edition will equip you with the skills you need to use pandas 1.x to
      efficiently perform various data manipulation tasks, reliably reproduce analyses, and
      visualize your data for effective decision making‚Äîvaluable knowledge that can be applied
      across multiple domains.`,

        text: dedent`This is a killer book for the Python and data wrangling professional, making all other
        books look like elementary school treatments. I've read 7 Pandas books and 32 Python books that
        have Pandas sections. \[This\] is by far the strongest, most detailed, easiest to follow,
        best-exampled book, and easiest to understand of any of the 39 books read. All other books
        pale in comparison\[...\]

        The datasets are intuitive. \[...\] lots of example code appears on every
        single page, illustrating the features. The story and example code flow together, not skipping
        around or showing disjointed points. The chapters follow your workflow, from data ingest and
        EDA to data cleaning, data wrangling, visualizataion, and finally to applications.

        Thorough treatments are given to data cleaning, data wrangling, and data enrichment as separate
        topics, going into deep details on how to reshape and reindex data frames, how to do proper
        joins on data frames, left, right, inner, and outer, and how to do many other data cleaning
        and wrangling steps.\[...\]

        This is the first and best book you should buy for Pandas.`,
