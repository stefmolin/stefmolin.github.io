Greetings from the friendly skies! I'm writing this from the plane on my way back from [PyCon Colombia](https://2024.pycon.co/) (my first conference in South America üòÄ), which was held in Medell√≠n this year. Getting there required a stop in Panama, but thankfully my travel was largely uneventful. I made it to my hotel around midnight and went right to sleep because I was presenting the next day.

I needed to work through the flow of my talk, [Data Morph: A Cautionary Tale of Summary Statistics](/talks/#data-morph-a-cautionary-tale-of-summary-statistics), after adding some new slides in the middle (special thanks to a conference friend for sharing some relevant research!). Somehow I had forgotten (read: procrastinated üôÉ) about doing this until the last possible moment, which was during the talk right before mine (and before lunch).

I decided to review my slides in the room so I could also get a feel for the stage before going on. Little did I know, someone planning to attend my talk was getting a peek at my slides over my shoulder. It turned out she was speaking right after me and came for the day from Bogot√°. We made fast friends and took pictures of each other presenting.

The "room" was actually an auditorium, which looked like it was ready for a TED talk. It was by far the largest audience I've addressed and the first time I've presented on the same stage as the keynotes.<sup id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> I had a fantastic experience with an engaged crowd. Pictures (really good ones too!) of me presenting made it to the official PyCon Colombia social posts for that afternoon üòç, and one attendee listed my talk as [one of the top talks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matiasrebolledodezerega_pycon-pyconcolombia2024-activity-7206064883895820289-8dRY) of the conference.

After this talk, I wasn't done with my speaker duties. I was also running my [Beyond the Basics: Data Visualization in Python](/workshops/python-data-viz-workshop/) workshop on the third day of the conference in the 8:00 am slot üôà. In four years of presenting at conferences, this was the second time I was presenting multiple topics at a single event (PyCon MEA 2023 in Dubai was the first time I did this).

Short on sleep the morning of my workshop (due to the speaker's dinner the night before), I began to question why I was doing both presentations, but two hours later, with a classroom full of people that enjoyed the learning experience, I knew it was worth it. Some of the workshop attendees also mentioned being in my talk, and others inquired if I had written a book on data visualization (in addition to [the one on pandas](/books/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas-2nd-edition/)). Maybe one day, but I told them that [I'm currently working on something else](/blog/updates/2024/new-year-new-book/).

The rest of the day was a bit of a sleep-deprived blur, but I do remember Lorena Barba's keynote in which she shared how she used [Jupyter AI](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create lesson plans for university courses; a giant cake (with dulce de leche between layers üòã) called the PyCake, which went very well with the Colombian coffee<sup id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup> that was always available; and Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez's<sup id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup> [inspiring keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4HxaJRKEg),<sup id="footnote-4"><a href="#footnotes">4</a></sup> which he delivered in Spanish (at top speed until someone asked him to slow down üòÇ) despite the others being in English.<sup id="footnote-5"><a href="#footnotes">5</a></sup>

Overall, this was an incredibly well-organized event. All of the organizers and volunteers were extremely friendly and helpful. Bottled water was ready with each change of speaker. The venue, [EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), was a beautiful campus filled with exotic greenery that made you forget you were in a city. The lunches gave me a taste of some local foods I didn't try on my previous trips to Colombia. Kudos to all involved!

2. It wasn't [espresso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVli-tstM5E), but even drip coffee can be good if it is Colombian üòä. <a href="#footnote-2">‚Ü©</a>

4. Probably the best keynote I've ever been to and a fantastic way to end a conference. <a href="#footnote-4">‚Ü©</a>
5. On multiple occasions, when people who attended my presentations found out I spoke Spanish, they asked why I didn't present in Spanish. Maybe one day. <a href="#footnote-5">‚Ü©</a>
