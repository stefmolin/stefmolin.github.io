I was thrilled to see that today's Google Doodle was "[Celebrating the Flat White](https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-the-flat-white/)" &ndash; my morning coffee drink of choice.<sup id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> I've never been a fan of lattes, which have way too much milk, and don't get me started on what is typically served when you order a "macchiato" in America.<sup id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup> I want to taste the espresso.

The flat white is the perfect blend of velvety milk and espresso. It's very similar to a cappuccino, but the milk isn't as foamy (hence, the word "flat" in the name). According to [the writeup](https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-the-flat-white/) accompanying today's Doodle, "flat white" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary on this date in 2011. However, despite being around for 13 years, it can still be hard to find, especially when traveling. At home, I make it with my [Nespresso machine](https://amzn.to/3OR5FaR)<sup id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup> (latte art skills sold separately &ndash; more on that another time).

If you have never had a flat white and want to try it, make sure it is either on the menu or there is zero trace of bewilderment on the barista's/waiter's face when you ask for it. Otherwise, you are much safer opting for a cappuccino. Many places have tried to convince me &ndash; despite never having heard of the drink &ndash; that they can make it or *will try* to. They meant well, but, unfortunately, it has never turned out well. I'm hoping today's Doodle raises awareness ðŸ˜Š

Have you ever tried a flat white? What is your coffee drink of choice?
