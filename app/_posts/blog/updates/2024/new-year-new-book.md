Last Easter, I shared [Data Morph](https://stefaniemolin.com/data-morph/) with the world. This year, I am continuing the tradition of a big unveiling on Easter: I'm excited to share that I have started writing a new book!

For the time being, I am keeping this mostly under wraps, but I will share a few details here. First off, it is not pandas-related or even data-related, but it *is* a technology book on a topic that I'm truly passionate about. I came up with the concept for this book about a year ago, and I was eager to work on it. But [life got complicated](/blog/updates/2023/to-be-or-not-to-be/). When things calmed down again, I spent a couple of months creating this website, so I didn't get around to actually working on the book idea until earlier this month ‚Äì March 17th to be exact. (I'm ensuring I can precisely answer the "How long did it take you to write this book?" question later on.)

I'm approaching the writing process differently this time. I don't want to stress myself out like what inevitably happened with the other books. This book is entirely my brain child, and I am keen to shape every aspect of it. I haven't contacted any publishers yet because I want to go in with the initial text already written this time, and I am fully-prepared to self-publish, if it makes sense.

I have mapped out the chapters at a high level, and I absolutely love that I have all the flexibility to work on whichever chapter I please on any given day. I began with chapter 7, then did chapter 6, and now I'm working on chapter 8, with some outlining for chapter 3. This flexibility has allowed me to get into a flow that I have *never* experienced before, and as a consequence, I'm progressing much faster.

For this book, I'm targeting 10 chapters and around 200 pages.<sup>1</sup> I've been applying what I learned from James Clear's MasterClass,<sup>2</sup> and I aim to write a minimum of 500 words a day (again, on any part of the book I wish). I also limit my writing sessions to two hours a day, which prevents the book-writing process from taking over my life (a luxury I did not have with my past book-writing experiences).

My vision for this book is constantly evolving and concretizing. More than once, I have found myself cutting content from the outline that I was positive would be in the book just a few days prior. While these topics won't make it into the book, I plan to write [articles](/articles) for each of them. The first of which was [published on Friday](/articles/devx/pre-commit/setup-guide/).

As I'm embarking on this journey without deadlines, I don't know when I will publish. However, I *am* confident that I will finish. Borrowing some fortune cookie wisdom, I will say that "it will be published sometime in the future." Be sure to [subscribe to my newsletter](/newsletter) for more updates on the new book, including any articles that come out of the creative process.

Happy Easter! üê£
